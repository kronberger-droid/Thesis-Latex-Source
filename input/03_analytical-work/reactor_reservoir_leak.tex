There is no reasonable analytical solution for the leakage.
Use measurements of pressure drop inside the chamber as reference and interpolate it to get solutions for higher pressure values.
This forces the reactor to be treated as a reservoir with some static pressure.
Does this still make sense in terms of conservation of mass?
Do we need to create some region of expansion and contraction around inlet and outlet to make the equations work?
