Defined as for internal flows:
$$
	L_c=\frac{4A}{D_w}
$$
The wetted perimeter is defined as:
for a fully filled circular pipe:
$$
	P_w = \pi D \quad \rightarrow \quad L_c =\frac{4\pi R^2}{\pi 2R}
$$
fully filled rectangular ducts:
$$
	P_w = 2H + W \quad \rightarrow \quad L_c = \frac{4(HW)}{2H+W} 
$$
Letting W go towards infinity lets us approximate $L_c$ for a flow between two parallel plates.
$$
	\lim_{H \to \infty} L_c =  \lim_{H \to \infty} \frac{4(HW)}{2H+W} = 2H
$$
