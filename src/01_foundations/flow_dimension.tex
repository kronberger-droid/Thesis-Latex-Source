	The dimensionality of the flow describes how many spatial coordinates the values in a velocity field depend on.
	The flow through a constant area duct is usually described as a one-dimensional flow field only depending on the position $x$ along the length of the duct.
	In the case of variable area ducts the flow will be three-dimensional and has to be calculated for all spatial coordinates.
	But assuming only a slight change in area along the length of the duct the flow can be approximated using a one-dimensional flow field with enough precision.
	This is called quasi one dimensional flow. \cite{anderson2021modern}
