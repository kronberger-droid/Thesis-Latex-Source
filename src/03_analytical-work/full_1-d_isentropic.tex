This section treats the internal flow geometry as essentially a double throat nozzle. With both throats being chocked.
What is the resulting mass flow and where will the shockwave be located?
Major loss of information in the inlet and outlet region of the reactor.
The state variables essentially are only dependent on the Mach number and the previously defined stagnation properties and gas parameters.
