By assuming the flow through the assembly will be fully isentropic and pseudo one-dimensional it is possible to calculate the state variables at every point knowing the stagnation conditions and the ratio between the cross-sectional area at the point of interest $A_i$ and the at throat of the assembly $A^*$.\\
It must be noted that this is a very radical approximation since for the flow to be  considered pseudo one-dimensional the problem must be reduced to consist purely of variable area ducts.
This clearly overlooks the fact that when entering and leaving the reactor the gas has to perform a right angle turn to follow the flow path.
Another constraint on the duct geometry to achieve reasonable solutions assuming pseudo one-dimensional flow is that the duct must change its cross-sectional area gradually.

This won't be the case inside the reactor, since there is no way of slicing the reactor chamber to achieve a gradual change in cross-section, especially around the inlet and outlet.
