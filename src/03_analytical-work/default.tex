\section{Analytical work}
	Now that the fundamental principles used are set, this chapter focuses on answering as many questions from chapter \ref{sec:scope-objectives}.
	First the geometry is defined in a more rigorous way, to be able to define the characteristic lengths for every important point inside the assembly.
	While also defining the conditions inside the reservoir and the vacuum and how they influence the flow.
	Afterward, the expected flow regimes will be assumed, to confirm that the isentropic continuum flow regime is applicable.
	These assumptions will be confirmed by the following analytical calculations.
	Where first the assembly will be approximated by a variable area duct, without any leakage in the system, where one-dimensional isentropic flow formulations can be applied, and the assumptions made in the preceding chapter can be tested.
	Since this approximation come with a cost, mainly by ignoring the geometry and possible non-isentropic behavior in the reactor.
	Therefore, a short section going into behaviors in micro-channels and the problem of slip on the boundaries follows, which paves the way for a more elegant formulation, where the reactor is seen as its own reservoir with given stagnation conditions.
	Since a change in stagnation conditions corresponds to non-isentropic flow behavior, is trying to include those while still treating the parts isentropically in isolation.
	This makes it possible to include mass-flow of the leak in the reactor, whose influence on the Mach number of the inlet throat will be explored.
	Ending with a short argument on why using the given formulations are not applicable to solve the velocity distribution at the outlet and therefore possible numerical solutions are presented.
