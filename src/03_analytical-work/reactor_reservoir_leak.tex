There is no reasonable analytical solution for the leakage.
Use measurements of pressure drop inside the chamber as reference and interpolate it to get solutions for higher pressure values.
This forces the reactor to be treated as a reservoir with some static pressure.
Does this still make sense in terms of conservation of mass?
Do we need to create some region of expansion and contraction around inlet and outlet to make the equations work?

Since there is no way to make the equations work sensibly the goal of this section will be to use the middle of the chamber as the pressure input for the leakage calculation.
Calculating mass flow for one pressure or maybe two.
Then let the mass flow of the leak get bigger and bigger and see when the inlet turns supersonic.
