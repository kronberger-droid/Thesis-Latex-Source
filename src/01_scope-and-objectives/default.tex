\section{Scope and objectives}\label{sec:scope-objectives}
	The aim of this thesis is to develop a straightforward analytical framework that predicts flow behavior and estimates state variables at key positions within a micro-reactor assembly.
	These estimates will later serve as initial conditions for more detailed numerical simulations.
	Figure \ref{fig:technical-drawing} illustrates the reactor configuration, where reactants are mixed in the reservoir, pass through the inlet and reaction volume, and finally exit into the vacuum through the outlet—with a portion of the gas leaking at the reactor’s sealing interface.

The exhaust gas composition is analyzed via quadrupole mass spectroscopy. The part of the gas in the reaction volume leaks through the space between the sample and the sealing surface of the reactor (blue line).}

	The sections that follow, address four main objectives: identifying the dominant flow regime, quantifying the impact of leakage, characterizing the gas state close to the sample, and predicting some characteristics of the velocity distribution at the outlet.
	To achieve these goals, the analysis relies on established concepts such as the Knudsen and Reynolds numbers, along with one-dimensional isentropic flow theory.
	This foundation, which is detailed in the subsequent chapter on foundational principles, not only clarifies the interaction between the reactor’s geometry and gas dynamics but also lays the groundwork for future numerical simulations and experimental studies.	
\subsection{Type of Flow}
	The type of flow has major implications on which mathematical formulations and simulations are applicable, as well as the way the gas particles interact with each other and the walls of the assembly. 
	The main focus here is the Knudsen number and the idealized flow regimes connected to it.
	With the main goal being to assess the most likely flow regime governing the inside of the assembly and therefore determine the equations applicable to calculate the state variables at different points in the system and the throughput of the system as a whole.

	In preparation for numerical simulations it is also important to find a way to calculate Knudsen numbers and other flow parameters using given datasets of state variables without having to rely on flow regime specific methods. This will help to analyze transient regimes, encountered when the gas expands into the vacuum, using generally applicable methods.

\subsection{Impact of the leak}
	As described in the introduction of this chapter, there will be some leakage expected at the boundary between the reactor casing and the sample.
	This leak will inevitably lead to some mass-flow and therefore some pressure drop $\Delta P_L$ inside the reactor.
	This can lead to major changes to the steady state of the system, therefore influencing the gas-flow into the reactor just as the velocity distribution at the outlet.
	In summary the goal is finding the pressure drop $\Delta P_L$ caused by the leak and the effective mass flow $\dot{m}_L$ through it and use them to predict probable behaviors.\note{ This is not what we were able to find. Change it?}

\subsection{Behavior of the gas around the sample}
	Knowing more about the state the gas is in close to the sample is very helpful.
	These can be used to estimate values for diffusion rates to and from the surface, boundary layer thickness, and mean velocities and momentum of particles reaching the reactive surface. 
	Important metrics are the velocity, pressure and temperature of the gas and the type and behavior of flow.

\subsection{Velocity distribution at the outlet}
	After the gas leaves the outlet nozzle, it expands into a vacuum chamber where the gas atoms are ionized by an electron beam and picked up by the mass-spec, to measure the ratio of different products.
	This won't be the case for all atoms, since for an atom to be ionized it has to cross the electron beam, which is localized in space.
	The remaining gas has to be pumped out of the vacuum chamber and doesn't contribute to the ratio measured by the mass-spec.
	Therefore, it is important to approximate, how much of the gas leaving the outlet actually is able to reach the region of influence of the electron beam and will contribute to the measurement of the mass-spec.
	To answer this the velocity distribution of the expansion after the gas is fully rarefied is needed.
	This distribution can then essentially be treated as a source like surface, with no interaction between gas particles after this point, and can therefore be directly correlated to the amount of atoms reaching the sphere of influence of the electron beam.\\
	Knowing what determines the distribution of the outlet can also help identify changes to be made to the geometry or the reservoir conditions to increase the amount of atoms reaching the mass-spec.
