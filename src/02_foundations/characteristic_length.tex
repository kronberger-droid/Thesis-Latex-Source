The characteristic length $L_c$ essentially serves the purpose of scaling physical systems.
It is fundamental when calculating most dimensionless quantities especially if these are connected to the scale of the system.
As a result, these dimensionless quantities are typically expressed in terms of a characteristic length, which are defined for the whole system or for an individual component, so that the geometry can be described in an abstract, scale-independent way.
For internal flows the characteristic length is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	L_c=\frac{4A}{P_w} \quad \text{with} \quad P_w = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} l_i
\end{equation}
Where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $P_w$ is the wetted perimeter, which is defined as the sum over the length of edges in the cross-section in direct contact with the fluid.
For gaseous fluids the whole perimeter of the cross-section must be considered, therefore the wetted perimeter reduces to the perimeter of the cross-section.
The following section provides the characteristic length formulas for common duct shapes.

If the height $H$ of a rectangular duct is very small compared to its width $W$, it is more convenient to view it as an asymptotic case where the width approaches infinity ($W \to \infty$).
