A key aspect when calculating dimensionless numbers like Knudsen and Reynolds number is capturing the temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity.
For this purpose, Sutherland's law is used to express the dynamic viscosity $\mu(T)$ as 
\begin{equation}
  \mu(T)
  = \mu_{\text{ref}}
    \left(\frac{T}{T_{\text{ref}}}\right)^{3/2}
    \frac{T_{\text{ref}} + S_\mu}{T + S_\mu},
	\label{eq:sutherland}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\text{ref}}$, $T_{\text{ref}}$, and $S_\mu$ are empirical constants.
This formulation provides a reasonable approximation for many gases within a broad temperature range.
