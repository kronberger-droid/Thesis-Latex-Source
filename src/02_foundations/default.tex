\section{Foundational Principles}
	When dealing with advanced fluid or gas dynamical systems, before being able to formulate models to describe them, they have to be categorized.
	This is usually done by determining dimensionless numbers which values ought to describe the behavior of the gas and its interaction with its surrounding.
	Essentially the values of these dimensionless numbers give a clue on which formulations are applicable and if additional boundary conditions or considerations have to be taken into account.
	This first chapter will go into the details of how to calculate some of the most important dimensionless numbers and give insight on what the values of them imply and in turn which formulations become most applicable.
