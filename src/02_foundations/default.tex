\section{Foundational Principles}
	When dealing with advanced fluid or gas dynamical systems, they must first be categorized before suitable models can be formulated.
	This is typically done by determining dimensionless numbers whose values characterize the behavior of the gas and its interaction with its surroundings.
	Essentially, the values of these dimensionless numbers indicate which theoretical formulations are applicable and whether additional boundary conditions or considerations must be accounted for.
	This first chapter will detail the calculation of several key dimensionless numbers and discuss their implications for model selection and applicability.
