	abstract = {A review of gas flow in microchannels of different
	            cross-sections is presented in this article. The phenomenon of
	            slip, slip models and measurement of slip coefficient are first
	            discussed. The planar microchannels are dealt with in great
	            detail; the different analytical, experimental and simulation
	            approaches and solutions available in the literature are
	            reviewed. A review of literature on square, rectangular and
	            circular microchannels have revealed that these microchannels
	            have also been extensively studied. Information on other shapes
	            of microchannels such as triangular, trapezoidal and elliptical
	            is also presented. It is recognized that surface roughness may
	            play an important role; therefore the effect of surface roughness
	            on flow characteristics and overall pressure drop is given due
	            attention. It is further recognized that frequently the
	            microchannels may not be straight; therefore, microchannels with
	            bends or involving sudden expansion/contraction is considered.
	            Empirical correlations and equations are included for ready
	            reference.},

	abstract = {In this paper, both DSMC and Navier–Stokes computational
	            approaches were applied to study micronozzle flow. The effects of
	            inlet condition, wall boundary condition, Reynolds number,
	            micronozzle geometry and Knudsen number on the micronozzle flow
	            field and propulsion performance were studied in detail. It is
	            found that within the Knudsen number range under consideration,
	            both the methods work to predict flow characteristics inside
	            micronozzles. The continuum method with slip boundary conditions
	            has shown good performance in simulating the formation of a
	            boundary layer inside the nozzle. However, in the nozzle exit lip
	            region, the DSMC method is better due to gas rapid expansion. It
	            is found that with decreasing the inlet pressure, the difference
	            between the continuum model and DSMC results increases due to the
	            enhanced rarefaction effect. The coefficient of discharge and the
	            thrust efficiency increase with increasing the Reynolds number.
	            Thrust is almost proportional to the nozzle width. With dimension
	            enlarged, the nozzle performance becomes better while the
	            rarefaction effects would be somewhat weakened.},
