	            different steady states and how seemingly anomalous behavior of
	            the solution may be resolved. Numerical experimentation using

	            steps leads to erroneous results.},

	abstract = {A review of gas flow in microchannels of different
	            cross-sections is presented in this article. The phenomenon of
	            slip, slip models and measurement of slip coefficient are first
	            discussed. The planar microchannels are dealt with in great
	            detail; the different analytical, experimental and simulation
	            approaches and solutions available in the literature are
	            reviewed. A review of literature on square, rectangular and
	            circular microchannels have revealed that these microchannels
	            have also been extensively studied. Information on other shapes
	            of microchannels such as triangular, trapezoidal and elliptical
	            is also presented. It is recognized that surface roughness may
	            play an important role; therefore the effect of surface roughness
	            on flow characteristics and overall pressure drop is given due
	            attention. It is further recognized that frequently the
	            microchannels may not be straight; therefore, microchannels with
	            bends or involving sudden expansion/contraction is considered.
	            Empirical correlations and equations are included for ready
	            reference.},
