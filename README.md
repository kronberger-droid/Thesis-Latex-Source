This is the whole source document for my bachelors thesis.

It includes:
- every latex file used to compile main.pdf (compilation using [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/))
- every non self created file is located in input folder.
- every self created figure is either compiled or present in latex a .pdf file which can be opened using [ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org/)
- a nix flake which can be used to recreate the development environment using nix (works on any modern linux/macos): [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/)
- src folder will also include every program (python, matlab, smath, ... ) written in the course of writing this thesis. (but not at this moment!)
