To-Do:

- [ ] Idealized flow regimes and expected flow regimes together.
- [ ] Turbulence and Reynolds number toghether.
- [ ] Equations of state in seperate foundational principle.
- [ ] Speed of sound and machnumber in two subsequent paragraphs.
- [ ] Dimension of the flow and dimensionality of the flow together.
- [ ] Keep Important assumptions but only in a short section at the beginning of an analytical description.
- [ ] Make Geometry shorter and more concise. Maybe put more elaborate description of what happens into its own section afterwards.
- [ ] Develop an understanding of how to create an equilibrium for the chamber pressure.
- [ ] Read: Supersonic Gas-Jet Based Beam  Profile Monitor and integrate some thoughts and citations.
- [ ] Nozzle flow section in foundational principles.
